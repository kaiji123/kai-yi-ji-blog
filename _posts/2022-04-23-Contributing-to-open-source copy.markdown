## Introduction
As Open source projects have become more and more popular these days since it allows all users to contribute to the project. There will be a time when you want to contribute to the project in which you are very interested. However, contributing might be confusing at the beginning and that's why I created this blog to guide you through the process.

## Clone the repository !
The first thing you need to do is to clone the repo that you want to contribute. The most common way to clone is to use `git clone` command. Let's say there is a repo called `8-puzzle` from user `kai`. To clone the repo you to use `git clone https://github.com/kai/8-puzzle.git` command. What happens after that is very interesting.
You will have a that repo in your local machine but also Github will register the same repository under your user account name. The HTTPS of your repo name should be `https://github.com/<your-name>/8-puzzle.git`. What you have to do is clone your version of the repo using `git clone https://github.com/<your-name>/8-puzzle.git` in which you will make changes to.


## Create pull request
After making changes, you want to create a pull request in which the author will have to approve
