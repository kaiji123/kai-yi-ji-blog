## What is Python ?

As you know , Python is one of the most popular programming languages amongst Java, C++ and Javascript.It doesn't compile the code you write ,like C or C++ ,but instead it interprets the code (which means that it has an interpreter). 

## What is the difference between compiler and interpreter ? 

A compiler checks the whole code before running. That is why if you have some errors in your code then you won't see any results. On the other hand, interpreter translates your code line by line. In this case , even if you have some errors you will still see some of the results.

Python programming language is coded in C. Therefore , we consider it as high-level language rather than low level language. In a sense, it is more similar to Java because both of them are object-oriented. However, Java has its own virtual machine to compile the code.

There are many reason where you would prefer to use Python instead of languages C or C++. One of the use cases is the higher dimensional computation of data. One of the most popular libraries in Python is Numpy. 

## Numpy
This library handles most of the calculation such as matrices, vectors, eigenvectors or gradients. Using these functions we can easily create, for example, an AI which is highly dependent on matrices and gradients.

## Other libraries
There are definitely many other libraries that have important use cases. PyTorch, which is a library that you use for creating, is very popular among people who are interested in mahcine learning. Django, for example, is another popular library that web developers use for creating backend for their website. There will be more libraries creating for making programmer's task easier and this why Python has such a huge growrate these days.
